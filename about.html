          <p>My automotive career started back in 1972 when I was hired as an apprentice technician at Gateway Porsche / Audi. I learned my trade through on the job instruction and training classes through Riviera Motors Wholesale, the Porsche and Audi distributor. In 1985, I ventured out on my own, opening my  repair center, A & P Specialties and have been at this same location ever since. Through hard work, we have grown, employing 3 full time technicians and a service manager. I enjoy helping our clients and sharing my knowledge with the technicians on the “classic” Porsches. I strive to provide the best service possible and pride myself on our reputation. My wife, Kim, and I have been married over 40 years, raising two boys. Away from work, my favorite recreation is riding my modified jet ski on the Columbia river. I hope to continue running A & P Specialties for may years to come. -Alan</p>

          <p>Being a native of the Northwest, I love the climate and scenery in our little corner of paradise. I began a summer job as an apprentice technician at Gateway VW / Porsche / Audi in 1975. In just a few months, I was promoted to the service office as an advisor and dispatcher. After 10 years, I moved on to manage service departments for Ron Tonkin, Beaverton Toyota, Kuni BMW and the Hannah Dealerships. Alan and I have kept in touch over the years and when the time came, Alan offered me a position as his service manager. I am impressed daily at the dedication Alan has for hard, honest work, doing what is best for our customers, earning their loyalty and trust. My wife of 29 years, Lisa and I like to spend time at our family beach house in Pacific City. -Paul</p>

      <p>Long time customer, Deborah, has had her 1971 Porsche 914 since new. She has had Alan do ALL the service work and repairs at A & P and will let no one else touch the car. She will tell you the Porsche is NOT for sale and jokingly claims that it will used as her coffin.
      Thanks Deborah for you loyalty.</p>

          <p>Being new to Portland, we were told " A & P Specialists were as honest as the day is long."  This is so true!  All our experiences with them have been positive.  Alan and Paul are honest, have an excellent work ethic and stand by their work.  We would highly recommend them.</p>

          <p>Hands down great service.
          Dropped off my 09 Audi A4 Avant after taking it 2 other places because it was idling rough and no one else could figure out the problem.
          These guys are champs, they diagnosed and fixed the problem. Turns out it was a rear main seal that was broken.</p>

          <p>Alan is the best mechanic around. He is trustworthy, reliable, customer-first oriented, unequaled in fairness...
